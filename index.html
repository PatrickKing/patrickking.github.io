        <h3>What I'm Best At</h3>
        <p>
          <span class='pill best-pill'>React.js</span>
          The low-to-no-state and continuous re-rendering approach that React encourages for building complex UIs was eye opening when I first encountered it, and now it feels wrong to build UIs in any other way. React is one of those rare tools which changes the way you think about development.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class='pill best-pill'>Node.js</span>
          I began working with Node after several solid years with Rails, and the ease with which you can build a simple working server in Node impressed me. Promises (and asnyc/await) were good to learn too, but Node will never be my first choice for server development; Javascript has too many flaws as a language (as compared to say, Ruby) and Rails makes a lot of good choices for you by default.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class='pill best-pill'>Ruby on Rails</span>
          <span class='pill best-pill'>RSpec</span>
          <span class='pill best-pill'>Cucumber</span>
          The convention based layout of every Rails app is both its best and worst feature. Portable conventions are a huge aid to understanding a new app, I've been productive contributing to a substantial Rails app on day one after getting to the code. But Rails doesn't set you up very well to scale an app's size and complexity, it naturally encourages monolithic apps. Careful use of Ruby's excellent object orientation features is the way out.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class='pill best-pill'>Javascript (ES 2015+)</span>
          <span class='pill best-pill'>ESLint</span>
          Modern Javascript has grown into a more pleasant and powerful language. Despite all the new and useful features I use daily (modules, arrow functions, deconstruction assignments, classes), there are still numerous new features I haven't needed to tap into yet. I list JS together with a linting tool, because there are enough serious gotchas in the language that using a linter takes on the same importance as compiler checks in other languages. Some go further, using tools like Flow, React's proptypes, or languages like Typescript for stronger static checks. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class='pill best-pill'>Coffeescript</span>
          Rails introduced me to Coffeescript, and I was instantly sold on its clean syntax, indentation based scopes, and effort to reduce/eliminate "the bad parts" of Javascript. Less code is better code! Modern JS is the better choice for professional work, but I still enjoy writing my personal projects in Coffeescript.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class='pill best-pill'>Immutable.js</span>
          Immutable lets you build efficient, un-changeable data structures in Javascript. I had long heard the virtues of using immutable structures to drive apps but expected it to be challenging to use them, and I was pleasantly surprised just how flexible this library turned out to be. Immutable is easy to recommend for React projects of any complexity, and now I wish Javascript had a native ordered map type like the one Immutable provides.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class='pill best-pill'>Redux + Mobx + Flux</span>
          I lump these three tools together because they all address the same problem in similar ways: managing state for React apps. Creating a centralized store for an application's state and enforcing that it only change through actions submitted to the store is a great way to bring order to the chaos of an interactive UI, but it can result in components that are not very modular if used carelessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class='pill best-pill'>Git (CLI + Git Flow)</span>
          Git is a wonderful tool. I've always preferred the CLI over graphical tools, sooner or later your repository will get into a state that the GUI tool can't handle. At that point your only option is to sort it out at the console, so I reason that you might as well learn "the real interface" from the start. A personal favourite utility: gitk, a cross-platform graphical git history viewer. It's a little quirky, but blazing fast, supports most options that `git log` takes for searching/filtering commits, and works identically on Mac/Win/Linux.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class='pill best-pill'>D3.js</span>
          I began working with the D3 charting library after becoming familiar with React, and I would describe it as a middle point between React and jQuery. Like jQuery it targets parts of the DOM with selectors, and like React it permits you to map from data structures to DOM elements and hides some of the complexity of updating the DOM. D3 is fine for the occasional chart with a few simple interactions, but it has most of jQuery's problems when building complex applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class='pill best-pill'>Agile practices</span>
          Daily stand-ups, one week sprints, short weekly sprint planning meetings with JIRA tickets, extensive unit-testing, chat-ops, and the occasional pair programming session have been my way of life as a professional developer. I drove adoption of code review at VizworX on a project I lead, and was pleased to see colleagues on other projects adopt it too. Continuous integration is a great idea, but there is a maintenance cost to keep it online, my impression is that it only becomes worthwhile for teams larger than three or four developers.
